<h4>Benefits of AR's Rise</h4>

	<p>Rampant increase in augmented reality's presence throughout society:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>enhances user engagement</li>
		<li>increases the perceived value of products.</li>
		<li>will never die down. In fact, the smartphone industry is improving rapidly; therefore, augmented reality will always have a home.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Clearly, AR's climb to the top is inevitable. Reasons why its future is nothing to worry about:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Hardware readily available.</li>
				<ul> 
					<li>It just takes creativity, innovation, and ingenuity to implement the augmented reality attributes.</li>
				</ul>

			<li> Entertainment </li>
				<ul>
					<li>With AR, the interactivity is so engaging that it makes people want to come back to the product over and over again!</li>
				</ul> 
			<li> Sales </li>
				<ul>
					<li>In fact, AR increases the likelihood that a user will buy a product</li>
						<ul>
							<li>88% increase for clothes</li>
							<li>86% increase for furniture and home accessories</li>
							<li>61% increase for games</li>
						</ul>
				</ul>
			<li> Views </li>
				<ul>
					<li>See the world differently!</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Assistance with navigation</li>
							<li>Viewing events from the past play out in real life (i.e. seeing a horse drawn carriage from the 20th century on a street in present day)</li>
							<li>Quick history lessons</li>
						</ul>
				</ul>
			<li> Safety and Rescue </li>
				<ul>
					<li>Look at an area and see all the power lines and water lines</li>
					<li>Helps to understand an area that you've possibly never seen (for police officers, firefighters, etc.)</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
<h4>Potential Concerns of AR Usage</h4>
<p>Safety Concerns:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Can cause individuals to misjudge the speed of oncoming cars</li>
	<li>Underestimate reaction time</li>
	<li>Unintentionally ignore potential hazards in the real world</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Some injured while exploring environments in Pokemon Go</li>
		</ul>
</ul>
<p>Physical Health Concerns</p>
<ul>
	<li>Poorly designed AR interface can create the same effects of:</li>
 		<ul>
 			<li>Presbyopia, farsightedness, nearsightedness</li>
			<li>Tunnel vision (unable to see in the peripheral field of vision) that results from diabetes and glaucoma</li>
			<li>Age-related macular degeneration</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Focus can become an issue</li>
	<li>Difficulty adjusting to using AR wearables, in which they will be much more distracted and have longer reaction times</li>
		<ul>
			<li>In a test involving ~100 people, 5-10% of Glass users experienced so much strain that they gave up using it</li>
			<li>25% of these users experienced difficulty but were able to stick with it</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Vision impairing</li>
		<ul>
			<li>“Indeed, AR users may be at more risk than someone with a permanent vision problem, because they have developed no compensatory strategies for lost vision.”</li>
		</ul>
</ul>

<p>Privacy Concerns</p>
<ul>
	<li>Threat of malicious hackers accessing users’ cameras and GPS data</li>
		<ul>
			<li>“If a violent homophobe walks into a bar and his augmented reality glasses identify a person as being gay, it could become a potentially dangerous situation for that person."</li>
		</ul>
