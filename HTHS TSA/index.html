			<h1> Who Are We? </h1>
			<h2> High Technology High School </h2>
			<hr>

			<h3> A Techie School </h3>
			<h4> Since 1991, High Technology High School has been a chapter of TSA. It has undergone many leadership changes since then. As of the 2016-2017 school year, our chapter is home to 150 members, which comprises over 50% of the school's population. With students possessing immense talent and drive, there's no doubt that HTHS has been an extremely active member of the Technology Student Association...sending students to the State and National 
Conferences annually. In addition, we are proud to send students to become state officers as well, thereby continuing to spread the love of technological learning throughout NJ TSA.</h4>
