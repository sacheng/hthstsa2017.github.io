As of the 2016-2017 school year, our chapter is home to 150 members, which comprises over 50% of the school's population. With students possessing immense talent and drive, there's no doubt that HTHS has been an extremely active member of the Technology Student Association...sending students to the State and National 
	Conferences annually. In addition, we are proud to send students to become state officers as well, thereby continuing to spread the love of technological learning throughout NJ TSA.</h4>

At this conference, High Tech students shone with 7 trophies, 2 of which were 1st place finishes -- VEX and Software Development. This year, 2017, the TSA National Conference is going to be held at the Rosen Shingle Creek center in Orlando, Florida, where high school and middle school students from all over the country come together at one competitive gathering once again to showcase their skills and compare their ideas with students from different areas of the country. In addition to competition, students have the opportunity to interact with other like-minded geniuses, the future engineers and scientists, from other schools across the entire country and beyond.  </h3>

This is the second year that the 5-member HTHS team, Team 765A, competed in the VRC challenge. Also, this is the first year that a secondary HTHS VEX team, Team 765X, competed at the regional and state levels. They won the most prestigious award available, the Excellence Award, at their regional competition, where they were also tournament finalists. This qualified them for the state-level competition. These awards qualify them for the international level of competition, VEX Worlds, where they will be competing in mid-April.</h2></div>
