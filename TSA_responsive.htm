        <h1>WHO WE ARE</h1>
          <p>Since 1991, High Technology High School has been a chapter of TSA. It has undergone many leadership changes since then. As of the 2016-2017 school year, our chapter is home to 150 members, which comprises over 50% of the school's population. With students possessing immense talent and drive, there's no doubt that HTHS has been an extremely active member of the Technology Student Association...sending students to the State and National Conferences annually. In addition, we are proud to send students to become state officers as well, thereby continuing to spread the love of technological learning throughout NJ TSA.</p>

For the 2016-2017 season, the VRC challenge is STARSTRUCK, in which two alliances, composed of 2 teams each, earn points by scoring stars and cubes in designated zones in their respective zones and by hanging their robots on the Hanging Bar. This is the second year that the 5-member HTHS team, Team 765A, competed in the VRC challenge. Also, this is the first year that a secondary HTHS VEX team, Team 765X, competed at the regional and state levels. They won the most prestigious award available, the Excellence Award, at their regional competition, where they were also tournament finalists. This qualified them for the state-level competition. These awards qualify them for the international level of competition, VEX Worlds, where they will be competing in mid-April.</p>

            Within the Community
                Unfortunately, the HTHS chapter does not have many community activities due to the difficulty in organizing such a large club (the largest club at HTHS!). However, we do plan on having fundraising events in the future.

            We are hoping to put together a district-wide Relay For Life to raise money for the American Cancer Society - TSA's official charity.

        What is your favorite part about TSA?
        <br>
        Writing these webmaster descriptions. jk.
        Aside from the spectacular all-you-can-eat buffet at TCNJ each year (2 if you include the leadership conference), I am always fascinated by the people at TSA conferences. For example, last year at nationals, I discussed robot designs with a team captain from Georgia who went on to direct an international award winning promotional video for his team. I enjoy being surrounded by so many like-minded peers and to learn from the incredible projects they create for TSA.

        <br>
        <br>

        Why do you do TSA?
        <br>
        I often find myself standing, alone, in my shower, contemplating a single, elusive question: Why do I do TSA?
        Perhaps, I find great pleasure in stressful, chocolate-fueled all-nighters the week before a conference. Or perhaps, the name "TSA" appeals to my deepest, wildest dreams of frisking people as a proud employee of the Transportation Security Agency. As a second semester senior slowly succumbing to senioritis, I still find myself inexplicably and repeatedly drawn to TSA in a relationship that transcends all logic, like a Stockholm Syndrome victim.

        <br>
        <br>

        What are some chapter activities (past or present or future)?
        <br>

        What are your TSA responsibilities / title?
        <br>
        I'm the vice president of our chapter. I help with running the club and overseeing its activities - this involves attending meetings, organizing workshops for members, and generally offering assistance wherever I or my fellow officers see fit.

        <br>
        <br>

        How long have you been a part of TSA?
        <br>
        I've been a member of TSA since seventh grade, which makes six years now!

        <br>
        <br>

        What competitions have you participated in / are going to participate in?
        <br>
        Throughout my TSA career I've participated in a variety of competitions, from System Control Technology to Technology Bowl to Debating Technological Issues to VEX Robotics.

        <br>
        <br>

        What is your favorite part about TSA?
        <br>
        I really appreciate the variety of events available for members to participate in, but I'm also amazed by the strong sense of community TSA creates between participants. I was first drawn to TSA by the opportunity to try my hand at a variety of different events, all connected by the common thread of STEM experience and leadership. But I stayed in TSA because I realized I had forged new friendships with incredible people as a member. TSA creates a sense of community and engenders strong relationships between people who might have nothing in common besides the fact that they both belong to this incredible organization. I'm very proud to be a part of it.

        <br>
        <br>

        Why do you do TSA?
        <br>
        I'm excited about what the future holds for me, and I can't wait to get out into the world and tackle real, tangible problems. But until then, I want to get as much experience as I can in as many areas as I can -- and TSA is one of the best places to do that. Where else can I simultaneously indulge my interest in robotics and also hone my public speaking skills? Where else are aerodynamics and fashion design considered equally interesting and valuable? TSA gives me the opportunity to sharpen my technical skills while meeting bright and interesting people. TSA is a community I belong to, and gives me a sense of home. TSA is practically part of who I am -- so I can't really help doing it, can I?

        <br>
        <br>

        What are some chapter activities (past or present or future)?
        <br>
        Currently, our chapter is involved with fundraising for the American Cancer Society through the Relay for Life program. We're currently gearing up for our state conference, so that involves a good deal of logistical work on our end as officers. We're also preparing materials for our chapter members on the newly introduced LEAP program, and trying to make the transition as easy as possible for our members.

        <br>
        <br>
        
        Why do you do TSA?
        <br>
        I do TSA because I think it’s a great way to explore different aspects of technology! The events I have participated in are very different, ranging from digital arts to technology education to coding. TSA allows me to participate in all of these.

        What is your favorite part about TSA?
        <br>
        My favorite part of TSA is meeting people who share similar interests with me and being able to learn from them and actiely share my own ideas on subjects that I find really interesting.

        <br>
        <br>

        Why do you do TSA?
        <br>
        I participate in TSA because it provides a medium for further exploration of technology and engineering. In addition, TSA allows me to demonstrate what I have learned through interactive, hands-on competitions that I really find enjoyable and rewarding.

        <br>
        My favorite part about TSA would have to be attending the conferences and competitions and meeting other members from across the state and country. 

        <br>
        <br>

        Why do you do TSA?
        <br>
        TSA brings together a pool of highly intellectual students, all equally driven and intrinsically curious about the different fields of technology. In a generation where STEM is becoming increasingly prominent, TSA exposes these fields to middle and high schoolers who otherwise may not have been interested.

        What are your TSA responsibilities / title?
        <br>
        As the HTHS chapter Sergeant-at-Arms my main duty is to serve as doorkeeper for the organization. What this means is that it is my responsibility to ensure that meetings rooms are prepared for ahead of time, that meetings occur without unnecessary interruption, and that members of TSA feel comfortable in their events and part of the TSA family.

        <br>
        <br>

        How long have you been a part of TSA?
        <br>
        I am so excited to have been part of TSA for 2 years now!

        <br>
        <br>

        What competitions have you participated in / are going to participate in?
        <br>
        I have participated in Chapter Team and Extemporaneous Speech at nationals in Tennessee in 2016. In 2017, I participated in TEAMS and am a part of the Chapter Team again.

        <br>
        <br>

        What is your favorite part about TSA?
        <br>
        My favorite part of TSA is being exposed to the wide variety of events to choose from. TSA also allows me to branch out and meet talented upperclassmen who I may not have gotten the chance to meet otherwise.

        <br>
        <br>

        Why do you do TSA?
        <br>
        I do TSA because it is an incredibly fun way for me to explore and learn new skills and be a part of something bigger than myself. TSA introduced me to Relay For Life, an organization that raises money for cancer research which is a cause I have become passionate about. 

        <br>
        <br>

        What are some chapter activities (past or present or future)?
        <br>
        Our chapter fundraisers for Relay for Life through luminaria sales and encouraging donations. We also attend the event at the end of the school year. There, we get to hear the stories of cancer survivors and researchers while being surrounded by passionate people. I hope to encourage our chapter's participation in Relay for Life in the future to hopefully raise over $10,000 to join the revered "Purple Club".

        What are your TSA responsibilities / title?
        <br>
        I'm the New Jersey State President. As a state officer, I help put together the state and leadership conferences and increase membership and interaction within our state TSA. This year we've been focusing on improving communication within the state membership and giving members more opportunities to get involved and "define their future" through new design challenges, new conference events, and more college/career interaction. As President, I promote cooperation in carrying out the activities and work of our organization. The symbol of my office is the gavel.

        <br>

        How long have you been a part of TSA?
        <br>
        I've been in TSA for six years.

        <br>
        <br>

        What competitions have you participated in / are going to participate in?

        <br>
        <br>

        What is your favorite part about TSA?
        <br>
        My favorite part of TSA is all the people you get to meet and work with within your chapter, state, and at the national level. Because of TSA, I have a community of 250,000 friends and memories I will treasure forever.

        <br>
        <br>

        Why do you do TSA?
        <br>
        I do TSA because I love STEM, CTE, and all of the experiences that come with being a TSA member. I joined TSA in 6th grade because I wanted to learn more about science and engineering, and I've stuck with it ever since! TSA has given me the skills, experience, and mindset I need to lead in a technical world. It's become a huge part of my life and I'm grateful I get to give back to the organization as the NJTSA State President.

        <br>
        <br> 

        What are some chapter activities (past or present or future)?
        <br>
        Relay Relay Relay! Beginning last year, HTHS TSA puts together teams from each grade at HTHS to send to the Middletown Relay for Life to raise money for TSA's national service project, the American Cancer Society.

        Here's my bio from the njtsa website, you can edit it or shorten it to however best fits the website:
        Hello New Jersey TSA! My name is Aparna Ragupathi and I am your NJ TSA State President. I am currently a junior at High Technology High School, and this is my 6th year in TSA. I’ve attended four national conferences and have placed in events such as Essays on Technology and Prepared Presentation. TSA has become a large part of my life, and I am very excited to contribute all I can to the organization. Outside of TSA, I am a Bharatanatyam dancer and an editor for Curious Science Writers. I also play trombone for the Howell Marching Rebels and take part in my school’s student government. This year, I look forward to sharing my love for TSA and working together to "Define our Future" and make NJ TSA the best it can be.

        What are your TSA responsibilities / title?
        <br>
        I am the New Jersey State Historian of TSA. As historian, it is my job to keep "current and accurate records" of the organization. In other words, I am responsible for keeping notes on events/achievements as they occur throughout the year.

        <br>

        How long have you been a part of TSA?

        <br>

        What is your favorite part about TSA?
        <br>
        My favorite part about TSA is the state conference. I enjoy walking around and seeing what my friends and other TSA members have been working on. Also, it is very exciting to hear the names of people from High Tech being called at the awards ceremony.

        <br>
        <br>

        <br>
