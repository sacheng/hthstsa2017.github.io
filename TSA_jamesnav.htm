        <h1>WHO WE ARE</h1>
          <p>Since 1991, High Technology High School has been a chapter of TSA. It has undergone many leadership changes since then. As of the 2016-2017 school year, our chapter is home to 150 members, which comprises over 50% of the school's population. With students possessing immense talent and drive, there's no doubt that HTHS has been an extremely active member of the Technology Student Association...sending students to the State and National Conferences annually. In addition, we are proud to send students to become state officers as well, thereby continuing to spread the love of technological learning throughtout NJ TSA.</p>

                <h4> responsibilities: </h4>
                <p>I organize meetings (both officer and chapter), plan competition placement, send updates to and communicate with the rest of the chapter, and generally try to continually improve HTHS TSA</p>
                <h4> competitions involved in: </h4>
                <p> Transportation Modeling, Digital Video Production </p>
                <h4> favorite part about TSA: </h4>
                <p> I love that above all, TSA is a community of people who are all passionate about STEM. We help each other learn, and we push each other to be better. Whenever I go to a conference, whether it's a State or National Conference, I am always struck by how everyone bonds over their shared interests.</p>
                <h4> why I do TSA: </h4>
                <p> There is always room to improve and grow, and TSA really fosters that growth by giving us as high school students the opportunity to pick a competition and field we are interested in, and then to become well-versed in that area of study or application. There are a multitude of competitions to choose from, and over the years, I have personally picked up knowledge in things like modeling, carving, 3D CAD, alternative energy, military vehicles, etc. through my competing in the Transportation Modeling competition. </p>
                <h5> I am thrilled to also give back to my school community by helping lead our chapter's TSA; it's an honor to spread the love of technology and curiosity that TSA inspires. </h5>

                <h4> why I do TSA: </h4>
                <p> I do TSA for the fun and experience I get from completing the projects- I've learned how to efficiently work together and have also been exposed to new things such as Arduino. Traveling with friends is also a great experience. TSA has honestly been a great experience and I'd definitely do it again if I were to relive high school.  </p>

                <p> It helps me explore my interests in STEM before I go off to college, and it supplements the STEM-focused learning at HTHS already. I also really like to lead others, and working as a TSA officer has been a fun, challenging, but rewarding experience. </p>

                <h4> favorite part about TSA: </h4>
                <p> My favorite part of TSA is the lunch at TCNJ. After working hard the week before, it feels good to sit down with team members and just relax and eat.</p>
                <p> The following is my strategy for getting the most out of TSA lunch:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>I like to starve myself the week before to increase my appetite. It is important to stay hydrated to avoid health complications.</li>
                  <li>At the actual buffet, I start by sampling each stand. I get small portions of each and put them on the same plate to objectively compare their tastiness.</li>
                  <li>After sampling, I move on to the actual eating. I will choose my top 5 dishes and eat a full plate of each. </li>
                  <li>For drinks, I like to mix everything available in the soda machines to get a more holistic view. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> why I do TSA: </h4>
                <p> It gives me a reason to explore different subjects in STEM that I am interested in. From robotics to dragster design, there are so many different interesting competitions available. </p>

                <p> My favorite part of TSA is bonding with people within our school (biggest club in HTHS!) and with people across the state, learning more about technology-related topics every year.</p>
                <h4> why I do TSA: </h4>
                <p> Iit's awesome to work with people towards a common goal (whether its as an officer or as a competitor/participant). </p>

          <h1>HTHS TSA: VEX</h1>
            <p>The VEX Robotics Competition (VRC) is a robotics event for high schoolers. Teams build robots to complete an annual challenge. For the 2016-2017 season, the VRC challenge is STARSTRUCK, in which two alliances, composed of 2 teams each, earn points by scoring stars and cubes in designated zones in their respective zones and by hanging their robots on the Hanging Bar. This is the second year that the 5-member HTHS team, Team 765A, competed in the VRC challenge. Also, this is the first year that a secondary HTHS VEX team, Team 765X, competed at the regional and state levels. They won the most prestigious award available, the Excellence Award, at their regional competition, where they were also tournament finalists. This qualified them for the state-level competition. These awards qualify them for the international level of competition, VEX Worlds, where they will be competing in mid-April.</p>

            Within the Community
                Unfortunately, the HTHS chapter does not have many community activities due to the difficulty in organizing such a large club (the largest club at HTHS!). However, we do plan on having fundraising events in the future.

            We are hoping to put together a district-wide Relay For Life to raise money for the American Cancer Society - TSA's official charity.
