            In place of unit tests, POE uses group-based unit projects to assess the students’ design and analysis capabilities.  These projects require the students to research, brainstorm, prototype and test their designs.   In addition to a working design model, the students are also responsible for submitting a final design report and, in some cases, making a verbal presentation to the class.  Due to the project scope, the successful team must demonstrate strong collaboration among all members.

    <h4>Biological Engineering and Environmental Sustainability</h4>
    <p>BEES offers students an entirely different engineering learning experience than the other PLTW courses offered at High Tech by combining biology, environmental sustainability and engineering. Environmental Sustainability is a rapidly developing discipline that involves manipulating living organisms or parts of living organisms to create products useful to humans that also conserve and preserve our environment. Bioengineering is a sensitive and complicated type of engineering due to the moral and ethical decisions related to using living organisms. It is different from other traditional engineering disciplines, which primarily utilize non-living materials and processes.</p>
    <p>The problems that students work to solve in BEES involve, ensuring access clean water for all people, especially those in developing countries or disaster areas; remedying the global problem of food insecurity and malnutrition; and developing a cleaner, sustainable energy source using biological methods. Students design a water filtration system, using bio- and phytoremediation techniques, to be employed after a major natural disaster contaminates freshwater supplies in a region of the world; they learning genetic engineering and cloning techniques in order to design a GMO that can help bring nutritional food to a food insecure population; and they design a sustainable power plant that utilizes biofuels as a renewable energy source. All projects in BEES aim to solve environmental issues with sustainable and affordable solutions. Students must be able to look at environmental issues with a new perspective and having the skills and the courage to "think outside the box" allows them to design solutions that use biological organisms in a new an innovative way. This is the key to developing sustainable solutions that will allow us to provide basic needs to all people while protecting and preserving our environment for future generations. </p>

A whole generation is retiring and there are not enough qualified young people to replace them. Contrary to headlines, the U.S. is a world leader in precision manufacturing and innovation. Today's manufacturing is complex and high tech, requiring problem-solvers with good STEM skills.</p>
    <p>Some questions that students must think about throughout this course are: Is the process for making a water bottle the same as a musical instrument? How are assembly lines designed and automated?</p>
    <p>Some technologies used in this course include: Computer modeling, Computer Numeric Control (CNC) technology, Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software, robotics, and flexible manufacturing systems.</p>

    <h4>Digital Electronics</h4>
    <p>DE is the study of electronic circuits that are used to process and control digital signals as opposed to analog signals that are varying. This distinction allows for greater signal speed and storage capabilities and has revolutionized the world electronics.</p>
    <p> Digital electronics is the foundation of all modern electronic devices such as cellular phones, MP3 players, laptop computers, digital cameras, high definition televisions, etc. The major focus of the DE course is to expose students to the design process of combinational and sequential logic design, teamwork, communication methods, engineering standards, and technical documentation</p>
    <p>The course of study includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fundamentals of Analog and Digital Electronics</li>
      <li>Combinational Logic</li>
      <li>Sequential Logic</li>
      <li>Microcontrollers</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Computer Programming for Engineers</h4>
    <p>COPE is a rigorous introduction to programming in Java. Students begin by learning about basic concepts such as primitive data types and eventually progress to more advanced concepts such as algorithm analysis and recursion. Emphasis is placed on constant practice with programming projects, assignments, and assessments. By the end of the course, students are well-prepared to take the AP Computer Science A exam.</p>
    <p> This course develops computational-thinking skills through the medium of Android App development for mobile platforms. The course utilizes industry-standard tools such as Android Studio, Java programming language, XML, and device emulators. Students collaborate to create original solutions to problems of their own choosing by designing and implementing user interfaces and Web-based databases.</p>

    <h4>Dr. Dina Ellsworth</h4>
    <p>Class: Biological Engineering and Environmental Studies</p>
    <p>This is my first year teaching at High Tech and my first year teaching BEES, although seniors who took the course last year do comment that it was their favorite PLTW course.</p>
    <p>Previous engineering courses definitely helped the students master the engineering design process and have developed their innovative thinking skills. In BEES, however, most of our projects involve molecular biology and genetic engineering techniques which are not taught in other engineering courses, so they are facing new challenges and learning new skills in this course.</p>

    <h4>Mr. Chris Hanas</h4>
    <p>Classes: Computer Science and Software Engineering, Principles of Engineering</p>
    <p> Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSE) is a junior class that is taken as an elective. There are a lot of coding projects involved in this class, along with a main project that they work on all year round.</p>
    <p> Principles of Engineering is a class that all sophomores must take, and there are a lot of fun projects involved in that too, such as the soccer tower project and the bridge design challenge.</p>
